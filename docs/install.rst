Installation
============

Documentation installation
--------------------------

#. Execute the following command (it should be executed each time when documentation might be changed)::

    $ make -C docs html

#. Open generated documenation index :file:`docs/_build/index.html`.

.. _klever-bridge-install:

Klever Bridge installation
--------------------------

PostgreSQL setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Trust all local connections by editing :file:`hb_pga.conf` and by restarting the PostgreSQL server::

    $ sudo sed -i '/^local/c\local all all trust' /path/to/pg_hba.conf"

#. Create a new PostgreSQL database (**db_name**)::

    $ createdb -U postgres -T template0 -E utf8 -O postgres db_name

#. Create :file:`bridge/bridge/db.json`:

   .. code-block:: json

      {
        "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.postgresql",
        "NAME": "db_name",
        "USER": "postgres"
      }

MySQL/MariaDB setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Create a new MySQL/MariaDB user (**db_user**) identified by a password (**db_user_passwd**)::

    MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE USER `db_user`@`localhost` IDENTIFIED BY 'db_user_passwd';

   .. note:: Password can be omitted.

#. Create a new MySQL/MariaDB database (**db_name**) with character set *utf8* and collation *utf8_bin*. Grant full
   access on all its tables to **db_user**::

    MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE DATABASE `db_name` CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin;
    MariaDB [(none)]> GRANT ALL ON `db_name`.* TO `db_user`@`localhost`;
    MariaDB [(none)]> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

#. Create :file:`bridge/bridge/db.json`:

   .. code-block:: json

      {
        "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.mysql",
        "NAME": "db_name",
        "USER": "db_user",
        "PASSWORD": "db_user_passwd",
        "HOST": "127.0.0.1",
        "PORT": "3306"
      }

   .. note:: Password can be omitted if it wasn't set before. Host and port can be omitted if they don't differ from the
             values specified in the example.

Installation for development purposes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Create :file:`bridge/bridge/settings.py`:

   .. code-block:: python

      from bridge.development import *

#. Execute the following manage.py tasks::

    $ python3 manage.py compilemessages
    $ python3 manage.py migrate
    $ python3 manage.py createsuperuser

   .. note:: Execution of :command:`manage.py migrate` can take quite much time.

#. The last command will prompt you to create a Klever Bridge administrator **klever_bridge_admin** identified by a
   password **klever_bridge_admin_passwd**.
   An email address could be omitted.

#. Run a development server::

    $ python3 manage.py runserver 8998

TOOD: Installation for production purposes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Create :file:`/var/www/bridge/bridge/settings.py`:

   .. code-block:: python

      from bridge.production import *

Below instructions are given just for Debian (Ubuntu).
Adapt them for your Linux distribution by yourself.

#. Copy Apache2 configuration file :file:`bridge/conf/debian-apache2.conf` to file
   :file:`/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/bridge.conf`.
#. Start listen to port *8998*::

   $ echo "Listen 8998" > /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/bridge.conf

#. Copy directory :file:`bridge` to directory :file:`/var/www/bridge`.

#. Execute the following manage.py task after the ones that are executed during installation for development purposes::

    $ python3 /var/www/bridge/manage.py collectstatic

#. Make *www-data:www-data* owner of directory :file:`/var/www/bridge/media`::

    $ chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/bridge/media

#. Restart service apache2::

    $ service apache2 restart

Common installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Sign in at `<http://127.0.0.1:8998/>`_ with username (**klever_bridge_admin**) and password
   (**klever_bridge_admin_passwd**).
#. Populate the database and create a new Klever Bridge Manager (**klever_bridge_manager**) and a new service user
   (**klever_bridge_service_user**).

   .. note:: Population can take quite much time.

#. Either remember passwords generated for them or in addition change these passwords using Admin Tools
   (**klever_bridge_manager_passwd** and **klever_bridge_service_user_passwd** respectively).
#. Sign out and sign in on behalf of **klever_bridge_manager** with password **klever_bridge_manager_passwd**.
#. Enjoy!

Update for development purposes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Execute the following manage.py tasks::

    $ python3 manage.py compilemessages
    $ python3 manage.py migrate

#. If the last command failed it is recommended to do the following steps.
#. Delete the MySQL/MariaDB database::

    MariaDB [(none)]> DROP DATABASE `db_name`;

#. Create the MySQL/MariaDB database as during normal installation.

   .. note:: The user and its access to this database remain the same from normal installation. You don't need to set up
             them one more time.

#. Repeat all steps of normal installation starting from execution of manage.py tasks (rerunning of the server might be
   not required).

TODO: Update for production purposes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Klever Core installation
------------------------

Enjoy!

..
   TODO: Install Cloud tools
   -------------------------

   Cloud tools after all requirements installation do not need specific installation, but each tool requires configuration
   file to prepare. All tools have section *common* in corresponfing configuration files. The following configuration
   properties can be set there:

   * *working directory* it is a relative path in the current working directory to create directory for all
     generated files.
   * *keep working directory* implies not to delete existing working directory when running a tool again.
   * *logging* contains configuration properties for `logging <http://docs.python.org/3.4/library/logging.html>`_
     python package.

   Controller configuration
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Prototype for client controller configuration can be found in :file:`Cloud/conf/controller.json`. It is recommended to
   set up manually the following configuration properties:

   * *Klever Bridge* section contains *name*, *user*, *password* attributes which should be set according to Klever Bridge
     service user.
   * *client-controller* section contains consul configuration properties and an absoulute path to a directory with consul
     binary and directory with web-UI files in it.
     It is better to provide your own *Klever Bridge* service check and turn-on or off consul web-UI.
   * *node configuration* section contains configuration options which tell a controller which resources of your computer
     are available for a scheduler. It is recommended to leave enough RAM memory for the other programms running on the
     computer and to choose partition with enough disk space before running controller.

   Scheduler configuration
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Prototype for scheduler configuration can be found in :file:`Cloud/conf/scheduler.json`. It is recommended to set up
   manually the following configuration properties:

   * *Klever Bridge* section contains *name*, *user*, *password* attributes which should be set according to Klever Bridge
     service user.
   * *Scheduler* section describes scheduling configuration with the following major attributes:
       * *controller address* - address which is used to access consul (do not change it if you use default consul
         configuration).
       * *keep working directory* attribute implies not to delete generated working directories.
         If you are going to debug Klever Core or a verification tool it is recommended to set it as *true*, but it will
         cause problems in case of solving the same job or task twice.
       * *job client configuration*/*task client configuration* attribute corresponds to an absolute path to a file with
         job/task client configuration (see below).
       * *"verification tools"* contains names of verification tools, corresponding versions and absolute pathes to
         binaries of corresponding verification tools.

   Scheduler job/task client configuration
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Prototype for scheduler job/task client configuration can be found in :file:`Cloud/conf/job-client.json`/
   :file:`Cloud/conf/task-client.json`.
   It is recommended to set up manually the following configuration properties:

   * *client:benchexec location* configuration property corresponds to an absolute path to a root directory with
     downloaded BenchExec sources.
   * for jobs:

     * *client:cif location* configuration property corresponds to an absolute path to a binaries directory with CIF tools.
     * *client:cil location* configuration property corresponds to an absolute path to a binaries directory with CIL tools.

   * for tasks:

     * *client:cif location* configuration property corresponds to an absolute path to a binaries directory with CIF tools.
     * *client:cil location* configuration property corresponds to an absolute path to a binaries directory with CIL tools.
