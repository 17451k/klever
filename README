For now Klever documentation contains only deployment instructions.
You can either find it online at http://klever.readthedocs.io or build it yourself.

To build Klever documentation you need:
* Install Python 3.4 or higher (https://www.python.org/)
* Install Sphinx (http://sphinx-doc.org) and Read the Docs sphinx theme
    pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme
* Execute the following command from the source tree root directory (it should
  be executed each time when documentation might be changed):
    make -C docs html
* Open generated documenation index "docs/_build/index.html" in a web browser.
