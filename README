* Install Python 3.4 or higher (https://www.python.org/) and Sphinx
  (http://sphinx-doc.org).
* Execute the following command from the source tree root directory (it should
  be executed each time when documentation might be changed):
    make -C docs html
* Open generated documenation index "docs/_build/index.html" in a web browser.
