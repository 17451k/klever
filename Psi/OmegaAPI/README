For using Omega API you need only class JobSession():


1) Initialization with args: (username, password, [omega=None])
  where 'username' and 'password' - usernames and password of user registered in
  the Omega system. 'omega' is name of the server (default is 'localhost:8998')
  with port or without it.


2) After each call you can check if it was completed successfully:
- JobSession.status is boolean ('True' when everything is good);
- JobSession.err_code is last error code;
- JobSession.err_message is last error message;


3) Functions:
   # JobSession.set_status(identifier, status)
     - set status for the job with identifier = 'identifier'.

   # JobSession.download_file(identifier, destination)
     - download job archive .tar.gz and save to the file 'destination'
       with job's identifier is 'identifier'.


4) Job statuses:
    '0' - job is not started solving yet;
    '1' - job is solving;
    '2' - job solving was stopped;
    '3' - job was solved;
    '4' - job solving failed.


5) Only job operator can change job status and download it.


6) Job error status codes:
