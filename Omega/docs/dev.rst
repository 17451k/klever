Developer documentation
=======================

How to write this documentation
-------------------------------

The Omega documentation is created using `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org>`_ from
`reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ source files.
To improve existing documentation or to develop the new one you need to read at least the following chapters of the
`Sphinx documentation <http://sphinx-doc.org/contents.html>`_:

#. `Defining document structure <http://sphinx-doc.org/tutorial.html#defining-document-structure>`_.
#. `Adding content <http://sphinx-doc.org/tutorial.html#adding-content>`_.
#. `Running the build <http://sphinx-doc.org/tutorial.html#running-the-build>`_.
#. `reStructuredText Primer <http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html>`_.
#. `Sphinx Markup Constructs <http://sphinx-doc.org/markup/index.html>`_.
#. `Sphinx Domains <http://sphinx-doc.org/domains.html>`_ (you can omit language specific domains).

Please, follow these advises:

#. Do not think that other developers and especially users are so smart as you are.
#. Clarify ambiguous things and describe all the details without missing anything.
#. Avoid and fix misprints.
#. Write each sentence on a separate line.
#. Do not use blank lines except it is required.
#. Write a new line at the end of each source file.
#. Break sentences longer than 120 symbols to several lines if possible.

To develop documentation it is recommended to use some visual editor.

.. warning:: Please do not reinvent the wheel!
   If you are a newbie then examine carefully the existing documentation and create the new one on that basis.
   Just if you are a guru then you can suggest to improve the existing documentation.
